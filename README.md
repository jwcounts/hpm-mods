# HPM Modifications

We have developed several small MU plugins for various functions and extensions for Wordpress, as well as the HPM Podcasts plugin. HPM Mods rolls all of these plugins into a single place.

## Getting started

Download this repo, unzip it, and drop the `hpm-mods` folder into your wp-content/plugins folder. Then log into your site, go to the Plugins area and activate it.

HPM Podcasts instructions [are available here](./podcasts/).

## What Is Included
* Podcasts and Shows
* Configurable priority posts for the homepage
* Internal support for promotional banners and lightboxes
* Staff directory and staff bios
* Series support for pages
* Miscellaneous functions or modifications that aren't directly theme- or plugin-related

## Wishlist

This project is a work in progress. If you have ideas or run into problems, open an issue!

1. Add an overall admin screen with the ability to disable specific parts
